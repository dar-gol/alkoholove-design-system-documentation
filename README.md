A Design System is a key component for any application or website. It provides consistency, continuity and uniformity of look and user experience across different platforms and devices. For Alkoholove, we have created a comprehensive Design System, with its main elements precisely described.

## Colors
All the colors to be used in the project are precisely specified in our design system. This ensures visual consistency and harmony.

## Spaces
We have also defined spaces between elements, thereby ensuring the clarity and readability of our application.

## Icons
The design system also contains a library of icons that can be used across the platform.

## Typography
A fundamental element is typography - from H1 to footer. Each text element is precisely described in terms of when and how to use it, as well as predefined attributes such as color, line height, size, and font thickness.

## Buttons
The design system includes several types of buttons: primary, secondary, and ghost. Each button has precisely described rules of use.

## Additional Elements
It includes components like the modal and toasty, which have their place in the system and are detailed described.

With a comprehensive Design System, Alkoholove not only provides a satisfying user experience but also serves as a pattern for future projects. Thanks to the application of the design system, no matter the project in our application, we will always maintain consistency.
